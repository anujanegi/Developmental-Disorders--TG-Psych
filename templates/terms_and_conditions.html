<p>Our main goal for the Datathon - prioritized right from the beginning - is that it is a fun event for people who like thinking, coding and the competition! That being said, we expect every participant to behave in a fair manner towards all other participants. In principle that should be enough to state. Nonetheless, we added some more details explicitly in order to (hopefully) clarify all remaining uncertainties.

The challenge is a machine learning hackathon. This means that we expect you to use machine learning concepts to tackle the main challenge that you decide to work on. But within this framework you might be as creative as possible, and are even encouraged to do so! Besides your knowledge and experience you are allowed to use anything that is publicly available such as code snippets from the internet, pre-trained networks, additional data that you find online, etc. Important is only that it is publicly available and that you are indeed allowed to use it. In the end you and your team need to be the primary authors of your final code.

To mention a few things which are explicitly not allowed: First and foremost, do not exploit, do not try to reconstruct the private dataset and do not use any confidential/company code. In case you should have insider information regarding one of the main challenges, you may not use it and should choose the other one. Again, be fair towards all other participants such that everyone can enjoy the competition. This means that you are not allowed to spread any misinformation or manipulate other teams to gain an advantage. Stick to the team members that you registered with. Please do not collaborate with other teams or include any additional external people into your team.

We will ask everyone to submit their code such that if we recognize any suspicious behavior we can reproduce the results. Should there be a violation of the above rules, you and your team can be disqualified from the challenge at the discretion of the organizers. We reserve the right to add more rules if needed, and will communicate this to everyone. In case you are unsure about anything, please ask us. Last but not least, please also make sure that you have read, understood and do not violate the Code of Conduct.

Most importantly: Have fun!</p>
